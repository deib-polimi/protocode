# Protocode #

Protocode is a web application that helps you to prototype iOS and Android mobile apps. Thanks to its model-driven approach, you create a prototype app once for different operating systems.

## Features ##
Here's a list of the key points of this web application:

* __Widget based prototyping tool__: the user can create the pages that compose the prototype adding various controls such as label, edit texts etc. Now it supports 16 controls: button, label, edit text, web view, image view, video view, audio player, list view, grid view, photocamera controller, videocamera controller and audio recorder.

* __WYSIWYG Editor__: in other word the user can immediately see the final result without exporting the model and generate the project for iOS and Android. This is possible thanks to the built-in simulator of the supported OS. Actually there are two simulators: iPhone 5s for iOS and Nexus 5 for Android.

* __Auto-adaptative control views__: in order to have a responsive layout throughout all different operating system, the position of the controls are not given by absolute position, but it uses a constraint-based approach. The result is a responsive layout that auto-adjust on different mobile screens. The classic position system is allowed even if it's not recommended.

* __Drag & Drop positioning__: controls can be placed on screen via drag & drop. We can move the widgets on the simulator dragging them on it.

* __Easy creation of common functionalities__: how many times we have to spend a lot of time to create menus, tab bars on iOS, navigational behavior and listItems? All these aspect are very simplified and their creation require very few clicks!

## Requirements ##

In order to deploy the web application we need:

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/)
* [Compass](http://compass-style.org/)
* MobileCodeGenerator: this app is required to generate both iOS and Android projects from the model exported by Protocode.

## Installation ##

1. Download this project
2. Install all node.js dependencies. From the root of the project execute `npm install`
3. Install all front-end libraries using bower `bower install`
4. Start the server using grunt `grunt serve`
5. That's it! Now you have a server with this application up and running on [localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000)
6. If you want only minified and compressed version of this web application, just execute in the root of the project `grunt build`. Now you have in `/PROJECT_PATH/dist` the web application ready for distribution.
